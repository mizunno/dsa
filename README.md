# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains implementations of common algorithms and data structures, accompanied by corresponding test cases. The main objective of this repository is to facilitate learning, rather than providing optimized code for production environments. Contributions from the community are welcome.

Currently, all the code is written in `Python 3.10`.

## Structure of the Project

The project is structure as follows:
- Each algorithm or data structure category has its own Python script. For example, sorting algorithms are implemented in `sorting.py`.
- For each algorithm or data structure implementation, there is a corresponding script for unit tests.

In the future I would like to make this project a package that could be used to visualize the behaviour of the different algorithms and data structures.
